# SHeSoldIt
Larencia Bright Realtor Site

This is a website I created for my Wife since she is a Realtor.

It is a work in progress and will be updated as need be when new features need to be add or improved.

Main reason I created this for her is for me to get the experience as well as to have more stuff to add to my Repository.

If you would like to know more or if you live in the Atlanta Area Feel free to contact her and schedule some time so she can find your next Dream House.
